
This is an abomination of a project that I have done this year

First I just want to let you know, Yes I know this is no where near how you wanted
it done and I apologize for that. I'm prepared to received the lowest grade for this assignment,
I just needed to turn it in because literally two days ago I had nothing. 

Little heads up you have to go through all 50 questions in order to look at your
results. 

Again I apologize, If you'd like me to make it into how you wanted let me know. I'll 
be happy to continue working on this, it's just at the moment I'm Realllly pressed with Time
